  "body": "## What's Changed\r\n\r\n### #54 fix(simnet): fetch all accounts before processing instructions \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the automatic fetching of accounts before an instruction is executed. Before, only the program ID was fetched. Now, all programs involved in the account are fetched (unless they are available in the local LiteSVM cache).\r\n\r\n### #53 feat(core): add custom rpc module with `svm_setAccount` method \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the first of our *SVM Tricks* RPC methods: `svm_setAccount`. This RPC method allows overwriting any of the fields of an account. \r\n\r\nThe RPC method expects two arguments:\r\n 1. The pubkey of the account to update\r\n 2. An object with any account fields: `lamports`, `data`, `executable`, `rent_epoch`, and `owner`.\r\n\r\nAny of the fields specified in argument 2. will be applied onto the account associated with argument 1.\r\n\r\nHere is an example RPC call:\r\n```JSON\r\n{\r\n    \"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\",\r\n    \"id\": \"1\",\r\n    \"method\": \"svm_setAccount\",\r\n    \"params\": [\r\n        \"zbBjhHwuqyKMmz8ber5oUtJJ3ZV4B6ePmANfGyKzVGV\",\r\n        {\r\n            \"lamports\": 100000000000,\r\n            \"data\": \"0x2\",\r\n            \"executable\": false,\r\n            \"rent_epoch\": 1,\r\n            \"owner\": \"11111111111111111111111111111111\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/txtx/surfpool/compare/v0.1.10...v0.1.11\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> Surfpool is in pre-releaseâ€”handle with care! It might wipe out or ride smoothly, depending on the swell. \r\n> Always stay on the latest version for the best ride.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n# macOS (Homebrew)\r\nbrew reinstall txtx/taps/surfpool\r\n\r\n# Linux (Snapstore)\r\nsnap upgrade surfpool\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
